Project Problem and Hypothesis:

This is a project about the default rate exploratory with the Lending Club dataset. I am trying to investigate which attributes that I can use to predict the default action.

It seems like a classification problem and my outcome is binary data -- either default or not default. My original idea is to use multi-class logistic regression to approach my goal.

In my first step, I chose 7 attributes to explore. They are loan amount, term, interest rate, credit grade, issue date, loan status, address state.

My assumption is that the interest rate and the credit grade will contribute to the most when we predict the default.


Datasets:

These files contain complete loan data for all loans issued through the 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. The file containing loan data through the "present" contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the previous completed calendar quarter. Additional features include credit scores, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes, and state, and collections among others. 
Columns are index, id, member_id, loan_amnt, funded_amnt, funded_amnt_inv, term, int_rate, installment, grade, sub_grade, emp_title, emp_length, home_ownership, annual_inc, verification_status, issue_d, loan_status, pymnt_plan, url, desc, purpose, title, zip_code, addr_state, dti, delinq_2yrs, earliest_cr_line, inq_last_6mths, mths_since_last_delinq, mths_since_last_record, open_acc, pub_rec, revol_bal, revol_util, total_acc, initial_list_status, out_prncp, out_prncp_inv, total_pymnt, total_pymnt_inv, total_rec_prncp, total_rec_int, total_rec_late_fee, recoveries, collection_recovery_fee, last_pymnt_d, last_pymnt_amnt, next_pymnt_d, last_credit_pull_d, collections_12_mths_ex_med, mths_since_last_major_derog, policy_code, application_type, annual_inc_joint, dti_joint, verification_status_joint, acc_now_delinq, tot_coll_amt, tot_cur_bal, open_acc_6m, open_il_6m, open_il_12m, open_il_24m, mths_since_rcnt_il, total_bal_il, il_util, open_rv_12m, open_rv_24m, max_bal_bc, all_util, total_rev_hi_lim, inq_fi, total_cu_tl, inq_last_12m.


Domain knowledge:

I studie business in the school and I have some financial knoledge about how the bank will issue a loan. Nowadays a lot of financial institutions mainly use the FICO score to predict the default rate.

Project Concerns

There are 74 columns in the dataset. I probably need to do PCA to choose attributes rather than just do it arbitrarily.



Outcomes:

I want to build a logistic regression model or random forest model to predict the default action. The accuracy should be over 0.75 and the AUC should be over 0.8.
